- Make use of all Inertia features from v1 & v2

## Inertia v2 new features
- Polling
- Prefetching
- Deferred props
- Infinite scrolling using merging props and WhenVisible
- Lazy loading data on scroll

- When using deferred props on the frontend we should add a nice empty state with pulsing/animated skeleton/blocks. Check the docs before making any changes to ensure we are approaching this in the correct way.
