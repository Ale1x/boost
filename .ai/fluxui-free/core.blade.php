- This project is using Flux UI - Free. It has full access to the free components and variants, but does not have access to the Pro components.
- Flux UI is a component library for Livewire. Flux is a robust, hand-crafted, UI component library for your Livewire applications. It's built using Tailwind CSS and provides a set of components that are easy to use and customize.
- You should use Flux UI components when available.
- Flux UI components look like this:
<code-snippet name="Flux UI component usage example" lang="blade">
    <flux:button variant="primary"/>
</code-snippet>
- Fallback to standard Blade components if Flux is unavailable.
