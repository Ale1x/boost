## PHPUnit Core

- We are using PHPUnit for testing - if you see an example using Pest as part of a prompt, convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, make sure to also run the entire test suite to ensure things are still ok.
