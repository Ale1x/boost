> This is a template repository for new Laravel AI Assistants. [Start a new repo with this](https://github.com/ai-assistant/generate), clone it locally and search & replace the relevant things below:
>
> - `Laravel AI Assistant` with the package name (e.g. `Laravel Horizon`)
> - `ai-assistant` references to the vendor name / GitHub url (e.g. `laravel/horizon`) (*)
> - `ai-assistant` references to the publishing name (e.g. `horizon`) (*)
> - `Laravel\AiAssistant` references to the package namespace (e.g. `Laravel\Horizon`) (*)
> - `AiAssistant` references to the short package name (e.g. `Horizon`) (*)
> - `AI_ASSISTANT` references to the env variable names (e.g. `HORIZON`) (*)
>
> (*) Name cannot contain spaces.
> 
> After replacing keywords, take the following steps:
>
> 1. Rename any `AiAssistant` prefixes in `.php` file names in [`src`](./src) to the package name (e.g. `Horizon`)
> 2. Remove things you don't need like migrations, routes, resources, etc
> 3. Fill the package short intro and keywords in the [composer.json](./composer.json) file
> 4. Set the same short intro and keywords in the GitHub repository sidebar and set the website url to the package docs
> 5. Fill out the package long introduction in the readme
> 6. Set the correct link to the docs in the readme
> 7. Replace the `art/logo.svg` with the new package logo
> 8. Replace the `public/favicon.ico` with the new package favicon (optional)
> 9. Remove this quote block from your readme
>
> All that's left for you is to start building your new package! ðŸ›
